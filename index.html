    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>Good job on making it this far into the website. Take a breather, have some fun looking around.</p>
    
    <p>I'm a student learning web development. This is my very first website, and I'm excited to learn how to code with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!</p>

    <p>You don't need to know my age or school. My favorite subjects are Math and Science because I love solving problems and doing experiments.</p>

    <p>In this website, you'll learn about my hobbies and interests. I hope you enjoy exploring my page!</p>
